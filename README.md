# Image-scraping-with-search-engine-link
The script aim to download images from two search engine 'Baidu' and 'Google', after providing keyword and image limit, it should download images automatically.
The script currently having few problems:
1) the Baidu function can only download 60 images even if we set a higher limit, i guess it was becasue the search engine only provide 60 results, but i am not sure how to fit it. 
2) the Google function can only download 20 images even if we set a higher limit, not sure about the reason. 
3) Google function only download the very small icon-liky images but unable to download the actual images picutre. 

I am new to programming and new to GIT with 3 months experience as a hobbie, if there is anything no good about my code and my repository, please advise, thanks everyone.
